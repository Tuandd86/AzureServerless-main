# Use Case: Basic Inventory Tracking System for Small Businesses
## Objective
Develop a serverless web application to manage and track inventory for small businesses, focusing on essential functionalities using Azure's serverless technologies.

## Key Features
### Inventory Management with CRUD Operations:

Implement Azure Functions to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for inventory items.
Design a simple database schema in Azure Cosmos DB to store product details like name, quantity, category, and a low stock threshold.

Simple Web Interface:
Develop a user-friendly web interface for inventory management. This interface can allow users to add new products, update existing product details, and view current inventory levels.
The web interface can be hosted as a static website in Azure Blob Storage, utilizing Azure Functions to interact with the database.

Low Stock Alert System:
Create a function that regularly checks inventory levels against the predefined low stock thresholds.
If stock levels are low, the function triggers an email alert to the store manager using an email service like SendGrid (integrated with Azure).

### User Authentication:

Set up Azure Active Directory B2C for secure user authentication. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access the inventory management system.
Basic Logging and Monitoring:

Implement Azure Monitor and Application Insights for basic monitoring of the application, tracking function executions, and logging errors or anomalies.

## Technical Components
### Azure Functions:

The backbone of the serverless architecture, handling all backend logic and database interactions.
### Azure Cosmos DB:

NoSQL database service for storing and managing inventory data.
### Azure Blob Storage:

### To host the static front-end web application.
Azure Active Directory B2C:

### For managing user authentication and secure access to the application.
Azure Monitor and Application Insights:

For monitoring the application's performance and health, and for logging any issues.
Development Approach

Database Design: Start by designing the schema in Azure Cosmos DB. Define the necessary attributes for inventory items, like name, quantity, category, and low stock threshold.

## Backend Development:

Develop Azure Functions for each CRUD operation. Ensure these functions can interact effectively with Cosmos DB.
Implement an additional function for the low stock alert system. This function can run on a scheduled basis to check inventory levels.

## Front-End Development:

Build a simple yet intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Use Azure Static Web Apps or Azure Blob Storage to host this interface.
Connect the front-end with Azure Functions using JavaScript (AJAX calls or Fetch API) for dynamic content loading and database interaction.
Authentication Setup:

Integrate Azure Active Directory B2C for user authentication, ensuring secure access to the application.
Testing and Deployment:

Test the application thoroughly, focusing on the functionality of Azure Functions, database interaction, and user interface behavior.
Deploy the application using Azure's deployment tools, ensuring the front-end and back-end components are correctly linked.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Set up basic monitoring and logging with Azure Monitor and Application Insights, enabling tracking of application usage and performance.
Use Case Scenario
A small local bookstore wants to digitalize its inventory management to enhance efficiency and avoid running out of stock. They decide to use this Azure serverless web application for its simplicity and scalability. The store manager can now easily track inventory levels, receive email alerts for low stock items, and securely access the system from any device. This digital transformation allows the bookstore to better serve its customers and adapt quickly to changing demands.
