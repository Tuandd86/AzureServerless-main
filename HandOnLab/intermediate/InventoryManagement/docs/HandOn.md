Exercise 1: Setting Up Azure Functions (.NET 6) with Cosmos DB
Objective: Set up Azure Functions using .NET 6 and integrate with Azure Cosmos DB.

Steps:
Create a Function App:

In the Azure Portal, create a new Function App with .NET 6 as the runtime.
Develop an HTTP-triggered Function in .NET:

Use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to create a new Azure Functions project with an HTTP trigger.
Add NuGet package for Azure Cosmos DB SDK (Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos).
Implement Function to Retrieve Items:

In your function, use the Cosmos DB SDK to connect and retrieve items.

Example code to get items from Cosmos DB:

csharp
Copy code
public static class GetInventoryItems
{
    [FunctionName("GetInventoryItems")]
    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
        ILogger log)
    {
        var cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING"));
        var container = cosmosClient.GetContainer("InventoryDB", "Items");

        var sqlQueryText = "SELECT * FROM c";
        QueryDefinition queryDefinition = new QueryDefinition(sqlQueryText);
        FeedIterator<Item> queryResultSetIterator = container.GetItemQueryIterator<Item>(queryDefinition);

        var items = new List<Item>();
        while (queryResultSetIterator.HasMoreResults)
        {
            FeedResponse<Item> currentResultSet = await queryResultSetIterator.ReadNextAsync();
            foreach (Item item in currentResultSet)
            {
                items.Add(item);
            }
        }

        return new OkObjectResult(items);
    }
}
Replace Item with your model class.

Deploy the Function to Azure:

Publish the function from Visual Studio/Code to your Azure Function App.
Exercise 2: Implement CRUD Operations with Azure Functions (.NET 6)
Objective: Implement CRUD operations in .NET 6 Azure Functions.

Steps:
Expand the Function App:

Add new functions for Create, Update, and Delete operations.
Implement CRUD Logic in .NET:

Use the Cosmos DB SDK to write the logic for each operation.
Deploy these functions to Azure.
Exercise 3: Build a React Front-End
Objective: Develop a React front-end interface for inventory management.

Steps:
Create a React App:

Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
Implement Components to Interact with Azure Functions:

Create components for listing, adding, updating, and deleting inventory items.
Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests to your Azure Functions.
Deploy the React App:

Build the React app and deploy the build artifacts to Azure Blob Storage or Azure Static Web Apps.
Exercise 4: Implement Authentication in React with Azure AD B2C
Objective: Integrate Azure AD B2C authentication into the React app.

Steps:
Configure Azure AD B2C:

Set up user flows in the Azure Portal.
Integrate with React:

Use the MSAL library (@azure/msal-browser and @azure/msal-react) in your React app.
Implement components for login, logout, and authentication status.
Exercise 5: Implement Low Stock Alert Function in .NET 6
Objective: Automate low stock alerts with a .NET 6 Azure Function.

Steps:
Create a Timer-Triggered Function:
Add a new timer-triggered function to your project.
Implement logic to check stock levels and send alerts, possibly using an email service.
Exercise 6: Monitoring and Logging for .NET Azure Functions
Objective: Implement monitoring and logging.

Steps:
Enable Application Insights:

Link to your Function App in Azure.
Add Logging:

Use ILogger in your functions to add logging statements.
Exercise 7: CI/CD for .NET Functions and React App
Objective: Set up CI/CD for both .NET Azure Functions and React App.

Steps:
Create a CI/CD Pipeline in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions:

Define build and deployment steps for both .NET functions and the React app.
Automate deployment to Azure.
Test the Pipeline:

Make changes and push to your repository to ensure the pipeline works as expected.
