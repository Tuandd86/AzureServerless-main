#Use Case: Creating a serverless system to manage and process customer orders for an online retail business.

## Key Technologies:

Azure Static Web Apps: To host the front-end user interface for order management.
Azure Functions: For handling backend processes like order processing, inventory checks, and notifications.
Azure Cosmos DB: As a NoSQL database for storing order details, customer information, and inventory data.
Azure Logic Apps: For workflow automation and integrating various services (like email services for order confirmation).
Azure Event Grid: To manage events like order placement, cancellation, or modification.


## Workflow:

Order Placement Interface: Customers place orders through a web interface hosted on Azure Static Web Apps. This interface communicates with backend APIs.
Order Processing API: An Azure Function is triggered when an order is placed. It validates the order details and checks inventory in Azure Cosmos DB.
Inventory Management: If the product is available, the function updates the inventory in Cosmos DB and confirms the order.
Workflow Automation: Azure Logic Apps automates subsequent steps like sending confirmation emails to customers, notifying warehouse for shipping, and generating invoices.
Event Handling: Azure Event Grid handles various order-related events (like order modification or cancellation) and triggers respective Azure Functions to process these events.
Order Tracking and Management: The front-end application allows customers and administrators to track and manage orders, respectively. It interacts with Azure Functions to retrieve and update order status.

## Front-End Development Considerations:

Interactive UI: The front-end should provide an interactive and easy-to-navigate interface for placing and managing orders.
Real-Time Updates: Implement real-time updates for order status using Azure SignalR Service.
Security and Authentication: Secure the application and implement user authentication to protect sensitive customer and order information.
