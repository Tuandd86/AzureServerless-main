Azure Function for Image Resizing

Use Case Description:
When images are uploaded to a blob storage container, an Azure Function is triggered to resize the images to a standard size for thumbnails. 
This is a typical requirement for any web service that handles user-uploaded images and needs to display them in a uniform size across their platform.

Expected Outcomes:

- Learn to set up an Azure Blob Storage account.
- Create an Azure Function triggered by blob storage creation events.
- Use the SkiaSharp library or similar to resize images.
- Save the resized image back to blob storage in a 'thumbnails' container.

Step 1: Set up Azure Blob Storage
1. Sign in to Azure Portal:
    Go to https://portal.azure.com and sign in with your account.

2. Create a Storage Account:    
    Click on "Create a resource".
    Search for "Storage Account" and select it.
    Click "Create".
    Fill in the required fields such as Subscription, Resource Group (you might need to create a new one), Storage account name, and Location.
    Choose "Standard" performance and "BlobStorage" as the account kind (if available) or "StorageV2 (general purpose v2)".
    Click "Review + Create" and then "Create" once validation passes.
    
3.Create Blob Containers:
    Navigate to your new storage account and find the "Blob service" section.
    Click on "Containers".
    Click "+ Container" to add a new container.
    Create one container named "images" with private access level.
    Repeat the process to create another container named "thumbnails".
